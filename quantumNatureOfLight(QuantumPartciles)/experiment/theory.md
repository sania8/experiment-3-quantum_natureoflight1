<h3>Quantum nature of Light using Quantum particles </h3><br>
<p>Light exhibits two fundamental and seemingly contradictory natures, often referred to as the wave-particle duality. These two aspects are best understood through the following concepts:<br>
1. Wave Nature of Light:
<br>
<b>Interference and Diffraction:</b> Light waves can interfere with each other, leading to patterns of constructive and destructive interference. This phenomenon is evident in the interference patterns produced when light passes through multiple slits or reflects off surfaces.
<br>
<b>Diffraction:</b> Light waves also exhibit diffraction, bending around obstacles and spreading out when passing through small openings. Diffraction patterns can be observed when light encounters barriers or openings that are comparable in size to its wavelength.
<br>
<b>Wavefronts:</b> Light waves can be described by wavefronts, which are imaginary surfaces connecting points of the same phase. These wavefronts illustrate the propagation of light as a continuous wave.
<br>
<b>Polarization:</b> Light waves can be polarized, meaning that the oscillations of the electric field occur predominantly in a specific direction. This polarization property is characteristic of transverse waves
<br>
2. Particle Nature of Light:
<br>
<b>Photons:</b> In the early 20th century, Albert Einstein proposed that light is quantized into discrete packets of energy called photons. Each photon carries a specific amount of energy, and the energy is directly proportional to the frequency of the light.
<br>
<b>Photoelectric Effect:</b> The photoelectric effect, observed when light strikes a material surface and releases electrons, provided experimental support for the particle nature of light. Einstein's explanation of the photoelectric effect involved photons transferring their energy to electrons.
<br>
<b>Quantization of Energy Levels:</b> In quantum mechanics, light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation are treated as particles (photons) when interacting with matter. Energy levels are quantized, and transitions between these levels correspond to the emission or absorption of photons.
<br>
<b>Wave-Particle Duality:</b> Light particles (photons) exhibit both wave-like and particle-like characteristics. This duality is a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics and is illustrated by experiments such as the double-slit experiment, where light creates an interference pattern like a wave but also interacts with the screen as discrete particles.
<br>
This experiments  exhibit and explains quantum nature of light using quantum particles. The following are the requirements :<br>
1. single particle source (gun) , function (Ψ)<br>
2. two narrrow slits having function (Ψ)<sub>1</sub> and (Ψ)<sub>2</sub> respectively.<br>
<br>
Three cases will be there :<br>
1. When slit 1 is open : when slit 1 which has (Ψ)<sub>1</sub> as the function is on then both expected and observed pattern will be same and hence as a result a narrow pattern will be seen exactly in front of the slit.
Particle finding probablity will be |Ψ<sub>1</sub>|<sup>2</sup>.
<br>
2. when slit 2 is open:  when slit 2 which has (Ψ)<sub>2</sub> as the function is on then both expected and observed pattern will be same and hence as a result a narrow pattern will be seen exactly in front of the slit.
Particle finding probablity will be |Ψ<sub>2</sub>|<sup>2</sup>.
<br>
3. When both slits are openend: When both the slits are opened then the observed pattern is an interference pattern which is known as Copenhagen Interpreation using quantum particles. This is the pattern observed with quantum partciles for both slits.𝝍 describes the probability density of finding a particle at a particular point in  space and time.  Observed pattern : |𝝍<sub>𝟏</sub>+𝝍<sub>𝟐</sub>||𝝍<sub>𝟏</sub>+𝝍<sub>𝟐</sub>|<sup>*</sup>  = 𝝍<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> +𝝍<sub>1</sub><sup>*</sup> 𝝍<sub>2</sub> +𝝍<sub>2</sub> <sup>∗</sup> 𝝍<sub>1</sub> + 𝝍<sub>𝟐</sub><sup>2</sup>. This is the pattern observed when the partciles pass through both slit1 and slit2 . <br> where : 𝝍 is the function of space and time .
